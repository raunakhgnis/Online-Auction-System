# Online-Auction-System

Save: Create a file named README.md in the root directory of your main project folder (the one containing both backend and frontend folders).
Customize:
Project Name: If "Online Auction Platform" isn't your exact title, change it.
Java/Spring Boot/Node Versions: Update these if yours are different.
MySQL Credentials: Remind the user to update their application.properties with their actual credentials if they deviate from the example.
Frontend Port: Vite might occasionally pick a different port if 5173 is busy. The user will see it in their terminal.
Image Paths in DataInitializer: If you used different image names or locations, mention it.
License/Contributing: Add these sections if you plan to share the project or accept contributions. If not, you can remove them.
Screenshots (Highly Recommended): After you have the UI looking good, take a few screenshots (homepage, product page, profile) and embed them in the README. This makes it much more engaging. You can add them like this:
## Screenshots

![Homepage Screenshot](path/to/your/homepage_screenshot.png)
![Product Detail Screenshot](path/to/your/product_detail_screenshot.png)

Review and Update: As you add more features or change configurations, keep your README updated. It's the first thing people (including your future self) will look at.
